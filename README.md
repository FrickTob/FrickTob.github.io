Welcome to my website! Built entirely with vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML, I made this website to be a playground for gaining a deeper understanding of the basics of web development and to highlight my projects and experiences that I am most proud of.

If you are a member of a hiring team, interested in learning more about me, or just want to talk about ideas CS related or otherwise, don't hesitate to reach out to me! (contact info available on the site)

Thanks for spending some time exploring my site and don't forget to check out some of my other projects while you're here.
